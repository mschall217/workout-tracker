# workout-tracker
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

  ## Installation

  The key tools to making this project work are npm. The user must run “npm init -y” to get the npm data and then install the rpm inquirer packages by running “npm i inquirer”. This will allow the user to access the key packages of node that make this function.
  
  ## Usage
  
  As the description says this can be used by any one making an open source project for GitHub. This program takes an extra step off the developers shoulders.
